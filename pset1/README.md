===================

**Fill out both this file and `AUTHORS.md` before submitting.** We grade

How do I run this?
----------------------
36/38 unit tests pass
```
make check-all
```


Grading notes (if any)
----------------------

My first iteration of the pset I spent too much time trying to get all the sanitize to work, and got up to 23 all okay in sanitize, but that in turn messed up my previous implementation which had 36 regular passing tests down to 32-31. So for the sake of time I ended up going with my more messier version and just worked on heavy hitter as that counts for more points.



Extra credit attempted (if any)
